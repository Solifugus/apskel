============================
The Request Handling Process

  1. index.php: A request is received.
     - The request may come from the webserver or command line parameters, 
       imitating a web request.

  2. identification.php: The identity (application version and environment) are
     determined from the domain name used.

  3. framework.php: The request parameters are cleaned, translated, and sent to
     the relevant controller.
     - The request may be called here either from step 2 or from a controller
       in step 4 (an internal sub-request).

  4. {module}_controller: The controller performs its designed actions and
     returns a set of response parameters to the framework.
     - A controller may make calls through the same module's controller or
       through sub-requests to other controllers via the framework (i.e.
       sending it back to step 3, recursively)

  5. framwork.php: The response parameters are formatted for the requester and
     returned thereto.  
     - If a response_format parameter is given, it will specify the formatting
       to use.  Otherwise, a default format will be selected depending on the
       requester type (i.e. http or https as html, or cli as text)
     - Possible values for the response_format parameter include:
       (a) text -- parameter name + colon + value + new line
       (b) xml -- value inside tag with parameter name (periods for tag levels)
       (c) html -- same as text, except in table
       (d) view={view name} -- uses named module view
       (e) template={template name} -- uses module template


==================
git Hub

How I started this for github:

git add -A *
git commit -m 'First Commit.'
git remote add origin https://github.com/Solifugus/apskel.git
git push -u origin master


TODO:
  - Add module index standard method--unknown or missing module methods
    are directed to this standard catch-all method (with unknown or missing
    method name passed to it, also)
  - If returned view begins with <? or <?php then insert variables immediately
    thereafter and eval, instead of echo'ing.  This will enable PHP view 
    templates.. 
  - Change all database calls to the Models class, whereby it merely gets and
    maintains (to share) its database connection from Framework.
  - Build environment migration tool to ensure the integrity of migrations
    through pre-established paths: e.g. 
               prod 1.0 -> dev 1.1 -> stage 1.1 -> prod 1.1 
    ensuring no mistakes in the process.  This means, adding a place to define
    allowed migration paths.  This also invites adding test-suites between
    migrations
