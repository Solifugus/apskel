apskel/notes.txt

This is the root directory for this installation of the Apskel framework.  


* The following describes the purpose of each directory (or directory type) that
should exist under the apskel/ directory:

- apskel/notes.txt

  This file provides generally useful notes on what resides within the directory
where it resides.

- apskel/README.dm

  Github requires a README.dm file to generally describe the project.  So this
file generally describes the Apskel project.

- apskel/LICENSE

  The contents of this file should be the GNU LGPLv2 from the Free Software
Foundation.  It is the license underwhich the entire Apskel framework is
distributed.

- apskel/webroot/

  The webserver should serve files under this directory only.

- apskel/identification.php

  The domain name (or substring thereof) to environment and version mapping
should be specified in this file.   

- apskel/environments_{version}/

  For each application version, there should be a different set of settings
files--one for each environment.  

- apskel/application_{version}/

  One for each application version, each of these directories should hold all
the code, structure, and theming files relevant to it.

- apskel/tools/

  This directory should hold command line executable tools for setup,
configuration, and development in the Apskel framework.
