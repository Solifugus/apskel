Forgive me if this is rough--I will improve and test this in later commits.

In theory, you need to to install and start apache mod_rewrite then add the 
virtual host (or one similar) in the setup directory.

Next, setup the environments/identifications.php file for URL-based 
environment identification.  The settings.php files should hold valid database
credentials, capable of creating tables.  Their creation should then be
automatic when each module is run.
