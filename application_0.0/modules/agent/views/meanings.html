	The meaning of a user statement is determined by which recognizer it first matches from top to bottom, as shown below.  Matched case and punctuation is also given priority.  Selecting a recognizer below will show possible reactions to the respective meaning.

<!-- Dialog for Recognizer Help -->
<div id="recognizer_help_dialog" class="web_dialog">
When the user enters a statement, we must determine what meaning that statement matches.  
Therefore, every meaning has a "recognizer".  A recognizer is just a text pattern to compare
with the user's statement.  If it matches then, we can presume that's the meaning.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Finding Best Match</b>.  Each user statement is compared against longest to shortest recognizer
(any wildcards counting as only one character).  First, full case and punctuation is compared;
Second, caseless punctuation; and third caseless without punctuation.  The first such match found
identifies the meaning and ceases the search.  If none after all this, the recognizer comprised of 
only one wildcard is chosen.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Wildcards</b>.  Any label within square brackets in a recognizer is considered a wildcard.  That
is, any text in that place of the user's statement matches there.  Any such text from the user's
statement is also preserved (as named) for use in the reaction.  For example:<br/>
<br/>
[somebody] really likes [something].
<br/>
The above recognizer could match "Mike really likes cookies.", whereby [somebody]
will hold the text "Mike" and [something] will hold the text "cookies".
</div>

<!-- Dialog for paradigm Help -->
<div id="paradigm_help_dialog" class="web_dialog">
Every meaning may have a set of available reactions. The "paradigm" is the method used to choose 
from among those reactions that are not ruled out by their conditions.  There are three paradigms:<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
	<li><b>natural</b> -- the same as cyclic, except as time wears on, these will slip backwards.</li>
	<li><b>cyclic</b> -- in order of priority first, list order second.  After all are used, it begins with the first again.</li>
	<li><b>random</b> -- each time, one is picked randomly.
</ul>
</div>
